This project analyzes the top 10 most commonly used drugs using data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques in Python. Leveraging libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the notebook explores usage patterns, demographic factors, and correlations between different substances. The aim is to provide insights into drug usage trends, highlight relationships between variables, and identify key behavioral or social factors influencing consumption. This analysis can be valuable for researchers, policymakers, and public health professionals interested in substance use patterns and intervention strategies. The code is clean, well-commented, and beginner-friendly for those learning data analysis.
